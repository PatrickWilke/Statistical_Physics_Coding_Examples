# Statistical_Physics_Coding_Examples
Example code for basic systems and concepts in advanced statistical physics 

This repository contains stochastic simulations of systems studied in statistical physics. Some are/were content of 
our lectures others are part of research projects. Unfortunately, research projects have to be published before the code
can be put online. Therefore, this repository is rarely updated, but with larger commits.
